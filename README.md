# Franco Mascarelo Ortiz

I build trading tooling and automation with a strong focus on **safety**, **testability**, and **cost-aware execution**.

## Public (CORE)

- **Aurum CORE** (`aurum-core`): educational MT5/MQL5 code (indicators + safe patterns).
  - Trading restrictions apply (no broker-connected automation in public).

## Private

- Custom development (paid/private): indicators, automation of *your written manual rules*, integrations.
- Partnerships / investor conversations: open to talk.

## Best way to contact

- Prefer **Telegram** (see my GitHub profile contact details).
- For repo requests/bugs: open a GitHub Issue (so requirements stay written).

## Disclaimer

Nothing here is financial advice. No profitability guarantees.
