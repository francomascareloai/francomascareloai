  - Public repo is *study/demo only* (no broker-connected automation).

## Private / partnerships

- Custom development (paid/private): indicators, automation of *your written manual rules*, integrations.
- Open to partnerships and investor conversations.

## Contact

- Prefer **Telegram** (see my GitHub profile contact details).
- For repo requests/bugs: open a GitHub Issue (keeps requirements written).

Nothing here is financial advice. No profitability guarantees.
